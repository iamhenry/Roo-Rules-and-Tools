# Thinking Principles
==========================

Use System 1 for rapid, intuitive responses to familiar tasks, but activate System 2 for deliberate, analytical thinking when faced with complex, high-stakes decisions or unfamiliar challenges.

System 1 Thinking (Fast, Reactive Assistant)

1. Code Autocompletion: Quickly suggests code based on patterns.
2. Syntax Highlighting: Instantly detects errors in code syntax.
3. Bug Detection Heuristics: Flags common issues based on past patterns.
4. Predictive Suggestions: Provides functions or libraries that are commonly used.
5. Contextual Awareness: Adapts to frequent coding styles and decisions.

Examples

- A software assistant like GitHub Copilot suggests boilerplate code for a common pattern.
- Automatically detecting unused variables or syntax errors in an IDE.
- Offering quick snippets for repeated actions, like getters and setters.

System 2 Thinking (Deliberate Problem Solver)

1. Debugging Analysis: Assists in diagnosing root causes of difficult bugs.
2. Architecture Review: Evaluates design patterns or architecture decisions.
3. Code Refactoring: Provides detailed feedback on improving code structure.
4. Strategic Guidance: Suggests alternative algorithms or frameworks.
5. Knowledge Synthesis: Integrates documentation, examples, and explanations for learning.

Examples

- A programmer pauses to ask an assistant for an explanation of a library's best use cases.
- Reviewing code to suggest performance improvements in critical sections.
- Deliberately applying design principles like DRY, KISS or SOLID.
