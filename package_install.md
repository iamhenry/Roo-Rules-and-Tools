# Package Installation Guidelines
==========================
When considering installing new packages or libraries:
  1. Debate the necessity by:
     - Explaining the package's purpose and core functionality
     - Identifying potential alternatives (built-in solutions, existing packages)
     - Assessing impact on bundle size and dependencies
     - Evaluating maintenance requirements and update frequency
     - Considering security implications and vulnerability history
  2. Present a conclusion with:
     - Clear recommendation (install/not install)
     - Justification based on analysis
     - Alternative solutions if not installing
     - Implementation plan if installing
